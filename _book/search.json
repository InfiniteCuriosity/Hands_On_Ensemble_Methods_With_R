    "text": "1 This book will put the most accurate tools to model nature in your hands\nThis book will guide you through the entire process of building your own ensemble models from beginning to end. I’ve done my very best to make the book very interesting, fun, and practical. There are lots of examples using real world data with all the steps included.\nIn the beginning there was a huge blizzard over Chicago. That’s how everything started.\nI do extreme sports for fun, such as white water rafting, snowboarding, and skydiving, and I’ve never been hurt. The single best way to be safe in extreme sports is to be totally predictable (no surprises!), communicate a plan before you start, and always be ready when things do not go according to plan. This book will follow the same system. This chapter will outline the book, and you’ll have a chance to get a glimpse of some of the highlights of our journey together. Then each chapter will guide you through the way to be the minimize surprises in your work, and we will look at what to do when things do not go as planned.",
